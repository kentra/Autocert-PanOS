## üêç Overview

`Autocert-PanOS` is an automated solution designed to simplify the process of obtaining and deploying Let's Encrypt SSL certificates for domains managed through Domeneshop DNS and Palo Alto Networks firewalls. It leverages Certbot for certificate issuance, interacts with Domeneshop's DNS API for domain validation, and uses Palo Alto's API to deploy certificates securely.

This tool is ideal for network administrators and security engineers looking to streamline SSL certificate management across multiple domains and firewalls with minimal manual intervention.
